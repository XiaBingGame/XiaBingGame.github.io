OpenGL ?rst became natively available for the Win32 platform with the
release of Windows NT version 3.5. Later, it was released as an add-on for
Windows 95 and then began shipping as part of the Windows 95
operating system with the OSR2 release. OpenGL is now a native API on
any full Windows platform (Windows XP, Vista, Win 7, Server 2003, Server
2008, and so on), with its functions exported through the opengl32.dll
library and supporting components in user32.dll. Many different levels
of OpenGL hardware are available for Windows platforms, from chipsets
with part of OpenGL implemented by software, to entry level video cards,
to screaming fast workstation class cards. You should be aware that your
application may be running on any one of these platforms.
